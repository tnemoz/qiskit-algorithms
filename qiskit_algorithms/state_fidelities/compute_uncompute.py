    This class leverages the sampler primitive to calculate the state
    fidelity of two quantum circuits following the compute-uncompute
    method (see [1] for further reference).
    The fidelity can be defined as the state overlap.

    .. math::

            |\langle\psi(x)|\phi(y)\rangle|^2

    where :math:`x` and :math:`y` are optional parametrizations of the
    states :math:`\psi` and :math:`\phi` prepared by the circuits
    ``circuit_1`` and ``circuit_2``, respectively.

                Higher priority setting overrides lower priority setting.

                This coincides with the standard (global) fidelity in the limit of
                the fidelity approaching 1. Might be used to increase the variance
